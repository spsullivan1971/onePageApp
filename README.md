<--Not very satisfied with this so far.  WHile it looks good I would have to admit much of the JS is not understood.  I made content and style changes but limited JS changes from script provided.

I think the tutorial is valuable but I need to study more of the code and the tutorial to fully understand her process and until I do I would say not very satisfied.

Will continue to personalize to broaden my understanding of JS, JQuery, the process etc.
